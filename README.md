# Machine-Learning

 You probably use it dozens of times a day without even knowing it. Each time you do a web search on Google or Bing, that works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank what pages. When Facebook or Apple's photo application recognizes your friends in your pictures, that's also machine learning. Each time you read your email and a spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam, again, that's because your computer has learned to distinguish spam from non-spam email. So, that's machine learning. There's a science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
